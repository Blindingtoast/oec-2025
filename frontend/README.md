# Frontend

This is a React application built using Vite, and the frontend to the CANotify

## Installation

Production builds are done using Docker and Docker Compose (see the readme a folder up), NGINX serves the /dist file generated by Vite

To install for local development, simply run the installation command (you will need Node.js and npm installed):

`npm install`

## Running

Run the development server using

`npm run dev`

This will open a developer server on `http://localhost:5173`, with auto-reload on changes to the code.


The development server will proxy API calls to the backend during development. To use these API calls, you must
also run the backend by following the directions of the README.md there.
